# DRLcontinuousActionSpace
This is a contorl project optimized and controlled by using deep reinforcement learning. Currently it's in progress and changes will be implemented. 
* in evn.py we have three mechanical models: 
1. A simple pendulum with spring and damper which should be in a desired angle trajectory. 
2. A simple non-linear 1DoF mass with desired trajectory. 
3. Project main model which desired trajectory.
